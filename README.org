Exercices from the C Piscine at 42 School.

+ The C Programming Language
  + The primary language learned at the 42's Piscine is C: dealing
    with variables, pointers, memory allocation, macros, as well as
    creating functions and programs, including the use and creation of
    libraries and Makefiles.

+ The Shell
  + The first two days of the bootcamp are dedicated to learning basic
    to intermediate shell commands to seamlessly navigate through the
    terminal.

+ Git
  + All projects are submitted via a remote git repository, which
    demands students to be at ease with such a system.
